# VG.no-rss written with node-webkit
Node webkit based app showing RSS feed from VG.no. Just a way of showcasing what can be done with node-webkit with just a few lines of code.

## Running the app
For playing with the code you will need to install node-webkit globally on your machine by running `npm install -g node-webkit`. After that you'll be able to run the app by doing `nw .` when standing inside the checked out folder.

## Building OS specific versions for distribution
Run `gulp nw` when standing inside the checked out folder. This will/should result in OS specific versions being generated inside the build folder.
